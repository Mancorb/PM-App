# Password Manager App
A python-based app, developed in Tkinter and SQLite, designed to help the average user create and administrate passwords that are designed to be complex enough to keep your accounts safe.

Currently, the app allows you to:

1.-Let the algorithm generates a new password for you and stores it.

2.-Register site, username, and password into the local database.

3.-Look up all the registered passwords in the local DB

4.-Modify & Delete registered passwords.

This project is still under development, if you encounter any issues, bugs, or have any suggestions please let us know in the issues section of the GitHub page.

NOTE:

The first time you run the program it's possible it may conflict with your antivirus software, no need to worry the app works locally (just you and your data), you only need to tell it to ignore it.

INSTALLATION:

Just download the Ver X.X .exe file (this file name will be changing due to the updates). This file is the installer with all the files you'll need (Exe file, logo img & local DB).
